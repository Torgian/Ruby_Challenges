Son, I want you to know what I really think of you. You are adverb amazing. When you were first born and I stared into your adjective adverb adjective noun I knew right then that noun would make me adjective. It's a adjective adjective world out there and there will come a noun when I wont be adjective anymore. You must take noun's issues adverb steps at a time. Make sure you verb your noun, be verb to noun, take verb of your noun, verb a adjective adjective noun first before verb a adverb adjective one, obey your grandmother and handle peer pressure the smartest way possible. Don't verb, say no to noun, don't verb and drive, verb a nice noun to verb your own, be great to noun and son never verb your dreams. Stay true to yourself and verb for what you verb. I know you verb to become a noun some day, make me verb! I love you son. -Joe
